This project contains source code used for the book, Android in Action, which is the second edition of Unlocking Android, both published by Manning Publications.


Many of the samples were slightly-to-significantly modified from the prior edition of the book.  Chapters 14-19 are new to this edition.

Authors:
  * Frank Ableson
  * Robi Sen

Some of the project code is either the original version or a modification to code contributed by Charlie Collins who was an author of the first edition.
